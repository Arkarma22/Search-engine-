🔍 Google Custom Search Node App
A simple Node.js app that uses the Google Programmable Search Engine (CSE) to search the web and filter results by domains you define.

🚀 Setup Instructions
Install Dependencies
Run the following command in your terminal:

npm install

This will install the necessary packages:

axios

dotenv

Get Your Google API Key & CSE ID
Step 1: Google Cloud Console

Visit the Google Cloud Console

Create a new project

Enable the Custom Search API

Generate an API Key

Step 2: Programmable Search Engine

Go to the Programmable Search Engine

Create a new search engine

Add the websites you want your search to be limited to

Copy your Search Engine ID (CX)

Create a .env File
In the root of your project folder, create a file named .env and add the following:

GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your-custom-search-engine-id

You can also use the provided .env.example as a reference.

Run the App
To start the application, use the following command:

node index.js

Then open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000

Type a search query and press enter. The results will be fetched from Google based on the sites you've configured in your Custom Search Engine.

🌐 How It Works
The app receives your search query from the browser.

It sends the query to the Google Custom Search API.

The API returns results limited to the domains you've specified.

Results are displayed with a title, snippet, and clickable link.

📁 Project Structure
index.js – Main server code

.env.example – Example environment variable template

.gitignore – Prevents node_modules and sensitive files from being tracked

package.json – Lists dependencies and scripts

package-lock.json – Auto-generated dependency lock file

🔒 Security Notes
Never commit your actual .env file to GitHub. It contains sensitive information like your API key.

The .gitignore file is already set to exclude .env and node_modules.

If sharing your project publicly, use .env.example to show others what variables they need.
